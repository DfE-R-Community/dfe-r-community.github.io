RStudio (the IDE) is produced by a company called Posit (previously they were also named RStudio) and this company offers several other enterprise software. One of Posit’s enterprise offerings is a web server for deploying and hosting R-based content - this is called RStudio Connect and is what we use at the DfE to share R content."

    "text": "Git & Azure Devops\nGit is a version control software that tracks changes to a project and allows you to better work collaboratively with others. Each project you work on should be contained within a Git repository (or ‘repo’ for short). Git repositories can also be linked to an online (or ‘remote’) repository, so that you (and anyone else) can save their changes to this remote repository. There are several free services for storing remote Git repositories: Github, Gitlab, Gitbucket being the most popular. As we are often working with sensitive data in the DfE and we have an existing business relationship with Microsoft, internally we use Azure Devops to host our remote Git repositories. Azure Devops has many functions, of which hosting Git repositories is just one, but for the purpose of deploying R content it is (along with release pipelines) the most important function. Repositories stored in Azure Devops are behind the DfE firewall."

What these Release Pipelines can do, is take the contents of a Git repository, bundle it up and send it to a server along with some code to be run with it. In the case of deploying R content, we bundle a Git repository with some code that says ‘Deploy this to our RStudio Connect server’ and then send it to our ‘Build Server’ (which is separate to the RSConnect servers) which runs the accompanying code and deploys the content."

    "text": "RSConnect\nAs mentioned above, RStudio Connect (RSConnect for short) is an enterprise offering from Posit which consists of a web server designed to host and share R content. It has many different features for simplifying management of a web server and a pretty front-end for users wanting to view any deployed R content.\n\nDfE Infrastructure\nAt the DfE, we have paid to have two RSConnect servers - one for Production (Prod) and one for Pre-Production (Pre-Prod). We also have 1250 licenses that can be assigned to colleagues in the Department. Note that licenses are required to view any restricted content and so the majority of people who want to view any deployed content will need a license.\n\n\nContent types\nRSConnect supports many different types of R-based content. It is important to note that the way in which we deploy content at the DfE is non-standard. If you read the RStudio Connect user guide, any references to deploying content straight from RStudio IDE or different methods for publishing can be ignored as they do not apply to our scenario.\nThe deployment process we use at the DfE will fail if it cannot detect the type of content being deployed. Below is a table explaining what types of content can be deployed and the file(s) that must be present in order for that to be detected.\n\nPossible RStudio Connect content types\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent type\nRequirement\n\n\n\n\nShiny app\nEither a file named ‘app.R’, OR two files named ‘ui.R’ and ‘server.R’\n\n\nRMarkdown\nA file named ‘index.Rmd’\n\n\nbookdown\nA file named ‘bookdown.yml’\n\n\npkgdown\nA folder named ‘docs’\n\n\nStatic HTML page\nA file named ‘index.html’ in a folder named ‘docs’\n\n\nplumber API\nA file named ’plumber.R\n\n\nQuarto\nNot yet available\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nThe internal RSConnect servers are behind the DfE firewall and can be accessed by anyone from a DfE device. If you do not have a license then you will only be able to view content which has been open to be viewed by everyone in the department.\nAll RSConnect apps on the Production server can be accessed with any web browser (although Chrome or Firefox are recommended), and can all be accessed via a URL that starts with https://rsconnect/rsc/… - the end of the URL will be different for each piece of deployed content."

If you are unfamiliar with Git, there are several tutorials online that can help - it is crucial that, at the very least, you are comfortable committing and pushing changes to a remote repository. You should ensure that you have a repository set up and you have committed your work so far.\nYour project must use renv: renv is an R package that allows you to manage the packages used in your project. It keeps track of which packages you have installed and what versions you are using. This is useful when collaborating with others as it allows you to quickly and easily make sure you are using the same versions of the same packages as your collaborators - reducing the risk of differences across devices. Package management with renv is crucial for deploying content to RStudio Connect, however, because it is used by RSConnect to install all the packages needed for your content to work.\n\nYou can easily set up renv for an existing project using renv::init() and making sure you run renv::snapshot() (and commit any changes to Git) before every deployment."

    "section": "Common types of pipeline",
    "text": "Common types of pipeline\nTo help with the process of setting up a pipeline, there are two templates provided below which you can download and use to set up your pipeline, following the instructions below. But first you need to understand a bit more about release pipelines and the difference between the two templates below.\nRelease pipelines consist of an artifact and one or more stages.\n\nThe artifact is the source for any code that is to be deployed - this is your Azure Devops repository that you’ve set up to host your project repository.\nEach stage, runs some code and optionally has some environment variables assigned to them which determine exactly how that code is run. In our case, we will use environment variables to determine whether we are deploying to the Production server or the Pre-Production server.\nEach stage can also optionally have pre-deployment conditions, which must be met before a stage is begun. In our case, we can use this to set an ‘approver’ for deployment to a stage - e.g. if multiple people are working on a project, a lead developer may have to give approval for any deployment to Production.\n\nWhen pipelines are set up, releases can then be created. Each release will travel from the artifact, along the pipeline and through each stage (as long as it passes the pre-deployment checks). An important point is that pipelines can be set up to automatically create releases whenever a change is pushed to the artifact (the Azure Devops repository). Combining this with the pre-deployment checks for each stage gives a multitude of options for how pipelines can work.\nIn practice, the vast majority of projects will suit either a 2-stage or 3-stage pipeline.\n\nIn a 2-stage pipeline:\n\nIf a change is made to any non-main branch in the repository:\n\nNo release is created\n\nIf a change is made to the main branch in the repository:\n\nA new release is created\nA ‘PreProd’ version of the content is deployed to the Pre-Production RSConnect server.\nIf that is successful, pre-deployment conditions for Prod are checked (i.e. an approver may have to give consent for the release to continue)\nA ‘Prod’ version of the content is deployed to the Production RSConnect server (this will be what customers/viewers of your content see)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo stage pipeline\n\n\nA 2-stage pipeline is best for content that will iterate quickly, might only have one or two people working on it and typically may not require much QA/checking of changes. The general workflow will be that every time a change is made to the main branch and the content has been deployed to PreProd, the developer will check that it looks as expected and there aren’t any differences to how it appeared locally. If they are happy that the change has worked as expected, they can then approve the change and it will be deployed to Prod.\n\nIn a 3-stage pipeline:\n\nIf a change is made to any non-main branch in the repository:\n\nA new release is created\nA ‘Dev’ version of the content is deployed to the Pre-Production RSConnect server.\n\nIf a change is made to the main branch in the repository:\n\nA new release is created\nA ‘PreProd’ version of the content is deployed to the Pre-Production RSConnect server.\nIf that is successful, pre-deployment conditions for Prod are checked (i.e. an approver may have to give consent for the release to continue)\nA ‘Prod’ version of the content is deployed to the Production RSConnect server (this will be what customers/viewers of your content see)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree stage pipeline\n\n\nA 3-stage pipeline provides more flexibility and more rigorous QA opportunities than a 2-stage pipeline. The general workflow will be that every time a change is made to a non-main branch of the repository, a Dev version of the content will be deployed to the Pre-Production RSConnect server. This can be then be viewed by the developer who made the change to see if it looks as expected. The Dev version will typically be where you test out potential changes where you are unsure if they will work as expected. Once you are happy that the Dev version is working, the changes can be merged into the main branch, which will trigger a deployment to PreProd. Here, the changes can be double checked, either by the developer or ideally another person. This is the final stage for ensuring the deployment won’t break anything and once this has been approved, it will deploy to the Prod version on the Production server and customers/viewers will be able to see the change.\nIf you are unsure which of the two pipelines is most appropriate for you, I’d recommend you default to the 3-stage pipeline as it allows more room for error and doesn’t increase the complexity of the pipeline too significantly.\nUse the buttons below to download the relevant template:\n\n\n\n Download 2 stage pipeline\n\n\n\n\n Download 3 stage pipeline"

    "text": "Creating your first release\nIf you have followed the steps above correctly, then whenever you push a change to the main branch of your repository it will create a new release for you. The first time however, it is easier to just manually create the release in Azure Devops itself.\nTo do this, go to Releases (i.e. see the first screenshot in the ‘Implementing your pipeline’ section) and select your pipeline on the left hand side - you may have to search for it and you should favourite it so that it is more visible in future. If you hover your mouse over the pipeline you will see a star you can click on the right.\n\n\n\nFinding your release pipeline\n\n\nOnce you have selected your release pipeline, you can click the blue ‘Create release’ button in the top right to manually create a release. You should see a menu like below (it may differ slightly depending on how you set your pipeline up and how many stages it has):\n\n\n\nCreate release menu\n\n\nYou do not need to change anything here, but for information:\n\nThe ‘Stages for a trigger change from automated to manual.’ section can be used to make sure that e.g. the release does not automatically deploy to Prod once Pre-prod has completed. This might be useful if you are manually creating a release but want to make sure it does not deploy to Production.\nThe ‘Artifacts’ section can be used to select a different commit than the most recent from the main branch. It is unlikely you will ever need to change this.\nThe ‘Release description’ section can optionally be used to add a comment to your release. This might be useful when you check back in future to remind yourself if there is a specific reason for you manually creating a release (rather than it automatically being created).\n\nClick the ‘Create’ button at the bottom.\nYou should see a new release appear in the ‘Releases’ section of the page (you may have to refresh the page). The release will be greyed out for all stages but will have started running the tasks of your first stage. You can click on the relase name to monitor the progress of the release but otherwise, wait for a few minutes until the stage(s) are complete. - If your stages all deploy successfully - great! You can continue with this section. - If one or more of your stages are unsuccessful, see the Troubleshooting section for common problems, or post in the DfE R Community Teams site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that sometimes a deployment stage will be marked as ‘Successful’ when it has in fact failed. This is because the status shown in Azure Devops denotes whether the app was successfully bundled and passed to RSConnect and is unaware of whether RSConnect successfully unpacked the app and can display it - although this will be visible from the deployment log.\n\n\nIf your app has successfully deployed to all stages - you’re almost done! There are just a couple of extra steps that need to be completed first.\nTo get more information on your release, you should view the log file for the deployment. To do this, click on a release and then hover over a stage of that release. A ‘Logs’ button should appear, click it. You should then be able to see the following page:\n\n\n\nClick on a release\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on a stage’s logs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logs for a particular stage\n\n\nIf you then click on the section titled ‘PowerShell Script’, you will see the detailed logs for the main section of the release stage deployment. It will look something like the below:\n\n\n\n\nRelease stage deployment log\n\n\n\n\nReading a deployment log file\nThe PowerShell script log is broken up into a few different stages - these correspond to the different stages of the ‘Deploy to RSConnect’ task.\n\nFirst, the script will print out some information about the Build server (which is where this task is occurring) and then print the value of all available environment variables. For example, if you look for the line that starts ‘RELEASE_ENVIRONMENTNAME’, that will be either Pre-Prod or Prod depending on which stage you are deploying. You can look through these to see what information Azure Devops knows about your deployment.\nThe task then tries to restore the developer’s environment. This is where renv is used to install all the packages necessary for your content to run. Note that this is installing these packages onto the Build server, before it then bundles the information up and sends it to the relevant RSConnect server. For this stage of the log file you will be able to see which packages and versions it is trying to install and whether it was successful.\nThe section immediately following the installation of R packages is where the Build server bundles the project and sends it to the RSConnect server. This section starts with the line ‘Preparing to deploy application…DONE’ (row 497 below) and ends with ‘Deploying bundle:…’ (row 503 below). If you see any warnings like those on rows 498-501, they can be ignored. Important: you will need to make a note of your app ID. This is visible on the line ‘Uploading bundle for application: xxx …DONE’ (row 502 below). In this case, the APP_ID is 693. Make a note of that for later.\n\n\n\n\n\nBundling stage of deployment\n\n\n\n\nAny lines that start with ‘[Connect]’ are output of code being run on the RSConnect server. The first lines of this section just print some information about the RSConnect server like R version and server info.\nFollowing this, the required R packages are installed on the RSConnect server (so the content can be run). This is when most issues will occur, so check this section if it looks like something has gone wrong.\nIf the deployment was successful, this section will end with the line ‘Application successfully deployed to…’ and then a URL (row 706 below). Make a note of this URL, as you will need it later.\n\n\n\n\nApplication successfully deployed\n\n\n\nThe final section gives some information on the deployment - this is stored for information governance purposes for access by RStudio Connect admins.\n\n\n\nFinal steps\nIf you remember back in the last step of ‘Implementing your template’, we saw there was an environment variable associated with each stage called APP_ID. This should be filled in for each stage with the integer number you saw in step 3 of reading your deployment log file above (i.e. the ID will be different for each stage).\nThe final step before being able to see your content is to raise some service desk requests. You can do that here\nThe first request should be for ‘Change App Access List’. For access you can choose either:\n\nEntire Organisation: which means everyone in the DfE will be able to view your content\nSpecific users/AD Groups: you can give the username/email of individuals (including yourself) to give them access to the content. Alternatively, you can specify an existing AD group to be used to restrict access.\n\nYou should then also request to add yourself as a publisher - same link as above (‘Change to user role’ -> ‘Publisher’). This will mean you are able to view the logs for your content once it has been deployed to RSConnect. In the ‘Justification’ section, put something along the lines of ‘I have deployed (’App X’) and wish to be added as a collaborator so I can view the content logs’.\nYou may also wish to change the URL of your content (Change App URL), as the default URL uses the app GUID and so is not user friendly. Here you can change the URL to something more relevant and easy to remember."
